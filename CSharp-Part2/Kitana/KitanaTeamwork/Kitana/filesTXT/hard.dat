Life is a box of chocolates.
People will shout my name worldwide.
Love is a very complex thing.
Six words can mean the world.
Say something nice or don't talk.
Dreams don't happen unless you try.
I am not an elephant man!
My room is an organized mess.
Moms cookies make everything feel better.
I love with all my heart.
